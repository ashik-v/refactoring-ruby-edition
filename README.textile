I'm working through the exercises contained in Refactoring Ruby Edition by Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, Martin Fowler, and Kent Beck.

Available here: http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Ruby-Jay-Fields/dp/0321603508

Rather than keep separate files for each step in the refactoring, "I have committed each step separately":http://github.com/chap/Refactoring-Ruby-Edition/commits/master

All code belongs to the authors of the book, so fork, share, steal, mock freely.
